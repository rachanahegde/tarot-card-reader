# Tarot Card Reader
Interactive and responsive tarot card reader website built with HTML, Tailwind CSS 4, and vanilla JS. The website is designed in Figma. 

## Design for Desktop Website

Note: The designs are intended to be guidelines so I plan to make changes as I go along because the goal of this project is to become mroe confident with coding in JS and using a popular framework like Tailwind. 

### Landing page version 1

### Landing page version 2 
I chose to build out this version because it provides more insights into how tarot readings work and guidance for people who are less familiar with how to proceed.
