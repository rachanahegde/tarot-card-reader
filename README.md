# Tarot Card Reader
Interactive and responsive tarot card reader website built with HTML, Tailwind CSS 4, and vanilla JS. The website is designed in Figma. 

## Design

### Landing page version 1


### Landing page version 2 
I chose to build out this version because it provides more insights into how tarot readings work and guidance for people who are less familiar with how to proceed. 


## Features (currently building) 
- Users can select 3 cards to get a reading on their past, present, and future. 
- Users can also ask an AI virtual assistant questions about their tarot reading and it significance.
